# Autostart Aternos

Autostart Aternos is as the title states it to be. This program/script runs a headless instance of Chromium to startup and maintain an Aternos server. This is meant to remove the process of manually starting up and monitoring your server. All that is required is a decent internet connection in order to maintain the instance.

At this current time there is no implementation to handle the queue system for Aternos. I do plan on adding that in but until I encounter it personally I'll just have to hold off.

- Program/script may fail during account creation if a captcha occurs
- Do not use 2FA with this due to it counteracting the point of automation
- Do not edit/replace/remove any files within the directory due the program being created to look in specific locations for files

May potentially get flagged as a virus, but it is not. All code is viewable if you're wanting to ensure your security.

If there's any questions or concerns then feel free to reach me on Discord at rxality#0001.

*Disclaimer: Using this program/script may violate Aternos's ToS and get your account banned. Use at your own discretion.*
